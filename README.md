# Mapoc

Mapoc is a tool to help you visualize the results of GoogleMaps Geocoding API.

You can test it online at [mapoc.io](http://mapoc.io/).

## How it works?

Just type an address in the search field and submit the form. The geocoded
results will appear. For each result, a reverse-geocoding request is done with
the coordinates received.

For instance, if you search "Paris, France", Google will answer the associated
point: "48.856614,2.352222". But if you reverse this point, you will find
a more precise address: "60 Rue de Rivoli, 75004 Paris, France".

## Why this name?

This is simply a shortcut between Map + PoC (Proof of Concept).
